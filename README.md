# semex

Website for crowdsourcing semantic explications.

Right now, it doesn't use a database, just one plaintext file per word. Several definitions per word are possible.

The submitted definitions are checked so that only NSM-words are used. The syntax for the inclusion of syntactic molecules and other definitions has to be discussed.

Feature wishlist:
- find equivalent words across languages
- find similar words
- possibly, tagging or categorizing words
- comparing the NSM space with word embeddings
